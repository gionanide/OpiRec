# Opinion_Recommendation

#### Abstract

###### Opinion recommendation is a task, recently introduced, for consistently generating a text review and a rating score that a certain user would give to a certain product which has never seen before. Input information driving opinion recommendation is all available reviews, text and rating for a product contributed by other users, and user’s text reviews submitted by the user under consideration to other products. Τhe aforementioned task is related to Natural Language Processing. Thus, facing the same problems in text generation using neural networks such as repetition, specificity. In this paper, it is demonstrated experimentally that deploying a repetition loss during training, repetition is reduced without adding extra parameters. Furthermore, the amount of repetition in the generated text review was defined as a measure of the captured information. Such measure is used to calibrate rating score prediction accordingly during testing, and significantly improved it.
