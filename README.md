# Opinion_Recommendation

#### Abstract

###### Opinion recommendation is a task, recently introduced, for concertedly generating a text review and a rating score that a certain user would give to a certain product which has never seen before. Provided information is all the available reviews, text and rating, for this product given by other users, and userâ€™s text reviews given to other products. The aforementioned task is related with Natural Language Processing, thus, facing the same problems in text generation using neural networks such as repetition, specificity etc. In this paper we demonstrate experimentally that deploying a repetition loss during training, we decrease repetition without adding extra parameters. Further- more, the amount of repetition in the generated text review was defined as a measure of the captured information. Such measure was used to calibrate rating score prediction accordingly during testing, and significantly improve it.
